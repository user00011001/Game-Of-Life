# Game of Life

Game of Life is a Python implementation of the classic cellular automaton simulation. It utilizes Tkinter for the graphical user interface and follows the standard rules of the Game of Life.

## Features

- Randomly initializes the grid with live and dead cells
- Applies the rules of the Game of Life to update the state of cells in each generation
- Visualizes the grid using Tkinter canvas
- Provides a continuous simulation with a configurable delay between generations

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included with Python)

## Usage

1. Run the script using `python3 life.py`.
2. The simulation will start automatically, displaying the grid and updating it in real-time.
3. Sit back and watch the mesmerizing patterns evolve!

## Acknowledgements

- The Game of Life was invented by John Conway.
